# Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a bank customer will churn using machine learning techniques.
It includes EDA, feature engineering, preprocessing, model training, tuning, and evaluation.

## Dataset
- 10,000 customer records
- Target variable: `Exited` (0 = No Churn, 1 = Churn)

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- KNN
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- SVM
- Gradient Boosting
- LightGBM
- CatBoost

## Best Model
- LightGBM (~91% Accuracy)

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
